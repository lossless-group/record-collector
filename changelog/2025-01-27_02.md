# Summary
Reorganized export functionality to centralize it on the Export page and added individual loading animations for record augmentation.

## Why Care
These changes improve user experience by providing clearer separation of concerns between record management and export operations, while adding visual feedback during AI augmentation processes.

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- **Removed Export All button** from `src/components/RecordCollector.js`
- **Added Download Local functionality** to `src/components/ExportPage.js`
- **Implemented individual loading animations** in `src/components/AugmentPage.js` and `src/components/RecordCard.js`
- **Updated icon imports** across components

## Technical Details

### Export Functionality Reorganization
- **File**: `src/components/RecordCollector.js`
  - Removed `handleExportAll` function (lines 18-47)
  - Removed `Download` icon import
  - Simplified header button layout to only show "Import CSV" and "Delete All"

- **File**: `src/components/ExportPage.js`
  - Added `Download` icon import
  - Implemented `handleDownloadLocal` function with CSV export logic
  - Added "Download Local" button between "Select All" and "Push to Remote" buttons
  - Button shows selected record count and is disabled when no records selected

### Individual Loading Animations
- **File**: `src/components/AugmentPage.js`
  - Added `processingRecords` state (Set) to track individual record processing
  - Updated `handleAugment` function to add/remove record IDs from processing set
  - Pass `isProcessing` prop to `RecordCard` based on processing status

- **File**: `src/components/RecordCard.js`
  - Added `isProcessing` prop (defaults to false)
  - Implemented loading overlay with spinner and "Augmenting..." text
  - Overlay appears when `isProcessing` is true with backdrop blur effect

## Integration Points
- Export functionality now properly separated between Record Collector (management) and Export page (export operations)
- Loading animations provide real-time feedback during AI augmentation process
- Consistent visual design maintained across components

## Documentation
- Export page now provides both local download and remote push options
- Loading animations clearly indicate which records are being processed
- User can select specific records for export rather than being forced to export all
